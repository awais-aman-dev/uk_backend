# UK Backend

Backend for the UK platform.

## Stack

- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- uv
- Docker
- Django Admin / Jazzmin

## Architecture

The backend is implemented as a Django monolith containing:

- Authentication and identity
- Customer cabinet APIs
- Packages, orders and subscriptions
- CRM
- Package entitlements and permissions
- Online Learning Platform
- Learning Admin
- Background processing
- Media/storage integrations

## Development

Requirements: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Docker.

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker compose up                                        # Postgres + dev server on :8000
docker compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate     # run migrations
docker compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

The source code is mounted into the container, so edits apply without rebuilding. Run
`docker compose build` after changing dependencies.

The `Dockerfile` installs runtime dependencies only (`uv sync --frozen --no-dev`) and runs
gunicorn by default; compose overrides that with `runserver`. Migrations are never run on
container start, so scaling out can't run them concurrently.

### API

| Area | Paths |
|---|---|
| Health | `GET /api/healthcheck/` |
| Authentication | `POST /api/auth/register/`, `login/`, `logout/`, `token/refresh/`, `password/reset/`, `password/reset/confirm/`; `GET /api/auth/email/verify/`, `POST /api/auth/email/verify/resend/` |
| Google sign-in | `POST /api/auth/google/`, `POST /api/auth/google/link/` |
| Catalogue | `GET /api/packages/`, `GET /api/packages/<slug>/` |
| Payments | `POST /api/payments/checkout/`, `POST /api/payments/promo-codes/validate/`, `GET /api/payments/orders/<uuid>/`, `POST /api/payments/webhook/stripe/` |
| Cabinet | `GET/PATCH /api/cabinet/profile/`, `POST /api/cabinet/email/change/`, `GET /api/cabinet/email/change/confirm/`, `POST /api/cabinet/password/change/`, `GET /api/cabinet/subscription/`, `GET /api/cabinet/learning-url/` |
| Documentation | `/api/swagger/`, `/api/redoc/`, `/api/schema/` |
| Admin | `/api/admin/` |

Clients send `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`. Access tokens last 5 minutes; refresh tokens
last 30 days with `remember_me`, otherwise 24 hours. Refreshing returns a new refresh token and
invalidates the old one.

In local development emails are printed to the container logs rather than sent, so verification
and password-reset links can be copied straight from `docker compose logs web`.

Google sign-in needs `GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS` set to the OAuth client ids the frontends use. While it
is empty, those two endpoints refuse every token.

Payments need `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Customers buy as guests: checkout
creates a pending order and sends them to Stripe's hosted page, and the order only becomes paid
when Stripe's signed webhook says so. To receive webhooks locally, forward them with the Stripe
CLI:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/payments/webhook/stripe/
```

### What happens after a payment

Stripe's webhook marks the order paid and queues a background job, which creates the account if
the buyer had none, grants access, and sends a welcome email with a single-use link to choose a
password plus a receipt. The job is safe to repeat: Stripe redelivers events, and each step checks
whether it has already run.

Access is two dates. `package_expires_at` ends learning access; `account_expires_at` is later by
`ACCOUNT_LIFETIME_COEFFICIENT` (1.5, editable in the admin), so a lapsed customer can still sign
in and buy again. Buying while access is live adds the new period onto the end, so nothing paid
for is lost.

Two scheduled jobs run from the `beat` service: expiry reminders at 09:00 and closing expired
accounts at 00:30 (never staff accounts). There is deliberately no job to revoke learning access,
because access is derived from the dates every time it is checked.

### Running without Docker

Point `DATABASE_URL` at any PostgreSQL 16 database and `REDIS_URL` at a Redis instance, then:

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env         # then adjust DATABASE_URL etc.
uv run python manage.py migrate
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

### Back office

The Django admin at `/api/admin/` is the back office, themed with Jazzmin.

Reaching the CRM is granted on purpose. `apps/staff` gates the areas holding customer data on
permissions actually recorded against an account, so being a Django superuser is not by itself a
way in — a superuser must grant themselves the permission first. That is least privilege by
default, not a wall against whoever administers the system.

Roles are declared in code, in each app's `roles.py`, and created by a migration:

| Role | May |
|---|---|
| CRM Manager | Look customers up and read their records |

`uv run python manage.py sync_roles` sets each role group's permissions to exactly what the code
declares, so permissions added by hand in the admin are taken back. No role carries
`crm.change_candidate` yet; grant it to an account directly, or add a role for it, once you decide
who may edit customer details.

A candidate's orders and access history appear on their page only for staff who also hold
`billing.view_order` / `entitlements.view_subscription`, so CRM access alone does not reveal
commercial history.

Staff changes to customer records go through `apps/crm/services.py`, which checks the permission
and writes an `AuditEvent` recording who changed what, from and to. Orders, subscriptions and the
audit trail itself are read-only in the admin: changing an order's price there would alter the
record of what somebody paid without moving any money.

### Settings

| Module | Used by |
|---|---|
| `config.settings.local` | `manage.py` (default) |
| `config.settings.test` | pytest |
| `config.settings.production` | `wsgi.py` / `asgi.py` (default); every deployed environment |

`manage.py` is the only entry point that reads `.env`. The production settings refuse to start
without `SECRET_KEY`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `DATABASE_URL` and `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`. See
`.env.example` for the full variable catalogue.

### Checks

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy .
uv run pytest                # needs PostgreSQL; set DATABASE_URL if not on localhost:5432
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs exactly these four commands on every pull request and on
pushes to `develop`, `stage` and `main`.
