# Container start command on Render's free tier.
#
# This is a prototype arrangement: one Render service runs gunicorn, the Celery worker and the
# beat scheduler together, because Render's Background Worker service type is not on the free
# plan. The trade-off is deliberate, but two things are *not* traded away:
#
#   - no task is silently lost: the broker uses noeviction and CELERY_TASK_ACKS_LATE is on, so a
#     task interrupted mid-flight returns to the queue;
#   - no process dies silently: if gunicorn, the worker or beat exits, this script tears the
#     whole container down (see the supervisor at the bottom) so Render restarts it and the
#     failure is visible in the dashboard rather than leaving a half-dead service answering
#     health checks while background work quietly stops.
#
# On a paid plan, set RUN_WORKER_IN_WEB=false and run `celery --app config worker` and
# `celery --app config beat` as their own Render services, as compose.yaml already does locally.
