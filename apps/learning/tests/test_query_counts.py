"""How many times the student endpoints ask the database.

The database is not on the same machine as the web server, so every query is a round trip over
the network and the count — not the complexity — is what makes a page slow. Listing the course
once cost six queries per chapter, which was fine with three chapters and four seconds with
fourteen.

These tests assert the count does not grow with the amount of content, rather than asserting an
exact number, so ordinary changes do not break them but a reintroduced loop does.
