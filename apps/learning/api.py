"""The endpoints students use to read the learning material.

What a student is served is decided twice over, and never by the browser:

* only material that is **live** — published, and past its scheduled time;
* only material their **package** includes, checked against the item, its subchapter and its
  chapter, so a package that excludes a chapter excludes everything inside it.

The frontend keeps its own words. A chapter is a "topic" and a subchapter is a "lesson" in these
responses, so renaming things inside the product did not reach the API. Keys are camelCase and a
lapsed plan answers 402, matching the contract the frontend already implements.
