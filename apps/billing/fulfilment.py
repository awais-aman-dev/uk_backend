"""Everything that happens after a payment succeeds.

Customers buy as guests, so this is where a purchase becomes an account with access: find or
create the account, grant the access, then send the emails. It runs in the background, triggered
by Stripe's webhook, and has to be safe to run again: Stripe retries deliveries, and a worker can
die halfway through. Every step therefore checks whether it has already been done.
