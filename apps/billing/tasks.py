    the payment and granting the access. Nothing else would ever notice. Stripe will not help —
    the event is recorded, so a redelivery is discarded as a duplicate, and the order is already
    paid, so even a fresh event stops at the "already paid" guard. The customer would be left
    having paid for nothing, permanently.

    It reads the database rather than the queue, so it does not matter how the access was lost,
    and it is safe on a schedule because every step of ``fulfil`` checks itself before repeating.

    tries again.
