"""Sending email without holding up the request.

One gunicorn worker serves the whole site on the free plan, so a request that waits for a mail
server stops the site answering anything — including the health check, which the platform reads
as a dead service and restarts. Registration did that: forty-six seconds inside the send, then a
minute of 502s. These tests are about the request never waiting again.
