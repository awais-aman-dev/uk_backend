    Nothing in a request should wait for a mail server. One gunicorn worker serves the whole site
    on the free plan, so a slow SMTP connection holds up every other request behind it — the
    health check included, which the platform reads as a dead service and restarts. Registration
    did exactly that: forty-six seconds inside ``send``, then a minute of the site being down.

    ``context`` is sent to the worker, so it must hold only values that survive JSON — strings
    and numbers, not model instances.

    If the queue cannot be reached the message is sent here instead, because an email that never
    arrives is worse than a slow request, and :setting:`EMAIL_TIMEOUT` bounds how slow that can be.
