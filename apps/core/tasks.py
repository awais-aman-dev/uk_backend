"""Sending email off the request.

Email is slow and its server is somebody else's. On the free plan one gunicorn worker serves the
whole site, so a request that waits for SMTP stops the site answering anything at all — including
the platform's health check, which then restarts the container. Registering an account should not
be able to do that, so the sending happens in a worker and the request returns straight away.
