"""The CRM's view of a customer.

``Candidate`` is the same database table as ``User``, presented for the people who support
customers: staff accounts are filtered out, and the current plan is reachable without writing a
query each time. Giving it its own model also gives it its own permissions, so CRM access can be
granted without handing over the Users admin, which carries the staff privilege fields.
